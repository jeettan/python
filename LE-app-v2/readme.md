#### Description: This is a health app to track and facilitate the healing process for a disease called Lymphedema.

# The PROBLEM:

# Lymphedema is a a chronic disease that requires daily treatment.

# Treatment is done by using a series of wrapping material and wrapping the affected body, with a 15 minute interval + 5 minute break for about 10 intervals/day, for management

# A standard at-home course would be opening up a YouTube video with a timer, pressing play, wrapping, going back to the YouTube video, setting up a 5 minute break, etc.

# Another typical way of recording the time would be using your phone and doing the timer manually.

# However, this process takes thought away from the actual treatment itself.

# The SOLUTION:

# This app is split into three sections:

# Section 1: Timer

# I created the timer section to resolve the problem of having to think through setting up timer. It's as simple as pressing a button and the information gets

# recorded automatically. Timer is created in the form of a tkinter widget instead of a webpage to keep things manageable.

# Section 2: Data collection

# I added data collection section for habit tracking and figuring out how many times of a wrapping cycle I have done / day for logging.

# Section 3: Information

# I added an information section which is a button that links to relevant content

# Conclusion - these three sections combined helps make the treatment process smoother and lessens the strain on the brain in terms of focus. Remember,

# treatment is not simply just going through the motions, it has a degree of discomfort and pain, so lessening the strain such as having to think,

# about "where is my timer" or "how many times I've wrapped," makes the process much more easier.

# Usage:

# 1. cd to directory 2. python lymphieapp.py
